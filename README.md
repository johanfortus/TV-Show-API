# TV Show API
TV Show API - Frontend App 

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to practice frontend development and API fetching.

A simple and user-friendly website designed to help users discover TV shows based on their search criteria. 

The web application was built using web technologies, including HTML for structure, Bootstrap for responsive design, JavaScript for dynamic interactivity, jQuery for efficient DOM manipulation, and Axios for making seamless HTTP requests to the TV Maze API.

This website utilizes the TV API from TVmaze.com. It connects to the TV Maze API to fetch detailed information about a wide array of television shows. Simply search for any type of TV show you're interested in, and it will present you with detailed information including show titles, descriptions, episode lists, etc.
